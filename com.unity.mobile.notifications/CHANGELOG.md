# Changelog

## [1.0.3-preview.3] - 2019-07-23

### Fixes:

- Fixed an issue with NUnit Test assemblies not being detected correctly due to which exceptions were thrown in the editor.

Samsung seems to impose a fixed limit of concurrent Alarms so if the limit is reached all attempts to schedule new notifications will be ignored until the currently scheduled ones are triggered or manually cancelled.
